### Chapter 01 -  Arrays and String

1.1 Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if
you cannot use additional data structures

1.2 Implement a function void reversefchar* str) in Cor C++ which reverses a null-termi-
nated string.

1.3 Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other.

1.4 Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. You may assume that the
string has sufficient space at the end of the string to hold the additional characters,
and that you are given the "true" length of the string. (Note: if implementing in Java,
please use a character array so that you can perform this operation in place.)

1.5 Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of
repeated characters. For example, the string aabcccccaaa would become
a2blc5a3. If the "compressed" string would not become smaller than the original
string, your method should return the original string.

1.6 Given an image represented by an NxN matrix, where each pixel in the image is 4
bytes, write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees. Can you do this in place?

1.7 Write an algorithm such that if an element in an MxN matrix is 0, its entire row and
column are set to 0.

1.8 Assume you have a method isSubstring which checks if one word is a substring
of another. Given two strings, si and s2, write code to check Ifs2 is a rotation of si
using only onecalltoisSubstring (e.g., "waterbottLe" is a rotation of "erbot-
tLewat").

### Chapter 02 -  Linked Lists

2.1 Write code to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list.
FOLLOW UP
How would you solve this problem if a temporary buffer is not allowed?

2.2 Implement an algorithm to find the kth to last element of a singly linked list.

2.3 Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle of a singly linked list, given
only access to that node.

2.4 Write code to partition a linked list around a value x, such that all nodes less than x
come before alt nodes greater than or equal to x.
